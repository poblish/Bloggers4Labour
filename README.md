_We had some good times..._

Code quality-wise, it's not great - or at least it doesn't look great with 10+ years hindsight. But it worked pretty well for a side-project with just one developer, running on a single dedicated server with 1 GB of RAM. At least there wasn't anything obviously better (technically) at the time.

Many of the scalability problems were solved with the Poblish project that followed, where we scaled from ~ 500 feeds to ~ 5000 with much better responsiveness and resilience. But that source code will have to wait for another day.
